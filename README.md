Meta-heuristic optimization algorithm of PSO(Particle Swarm Optimization)

In this repository you can find the code of Particle Swarm Optimization which is one of the meta-heuristic algorithm to find the optimum value of any function. 

The main concept is abstructed from Soft computing book by Simon and Paddhay. 
Later i modified the code as yu requirment. You can use this code and give me feed back and stat to my repository.
